# Umbrella Layer2 Oracle

## Conclusion and possible improvements.
I started working on this project awfully near the deadline and, though it is in a fairly working state, I didn't have time to implement all the features I would have liked to. I could not, for example, implement a reward system for the oracle (Using the UMB token, preferentially), and thus far it has only two available functions (queryValue and updateState) and it can only store a single type of value ("BTC-USD"). Of course, all these improvements could be easily implemented with some more time and work.
